# Movie Service Files - Issue Resolution Summary

## 🔍 **Issues Found:**

### **1. Multiple Movie Service Files**
- ❌ `movie_service.py` - **CORRUPTED** (had indentation errors, duplicate methods, broken syntax)
- ❌ `movie_service_backup.py` - **DUPLICATE** (unnecessary backup file)
- ❌ `movie_service_new.py` - **TEMPORARY** (clean version created during fixes)

### **2. Specific Errors in Original movie_service.py:**
```python
# Line 154 - Incorrect indentation
  async def analyze_movie(self, movie_id: str) -> str:  # Wrong indentation

# Line 159-161 - Orphaned code blocks
            return self._format_movie_data(result)  # No function context
        except Exception as e:                        # Unmatched try/except
            raise Exception(f"Movie details fetch failed: {str(e)}")

# Multiple duplicate method definitions
async def analyze_movie(self, movie_id: str) -> str:      # First definition
async def analyze_movie(self, movie_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:  # Duplicate definition
```

### **3. Import Path Issues**
- Routes were importing from `movie_service_new` instead of `movie_service`
- Main.py was also using the temporary service file

- ✅ **Deleted** duplicate `movie_service_backup.py`  
- ✅ **Deleted** temporary `movie_service_new.py`
- ✅ **Created** clean, working `movie_service.py`

### **2. Fixed Import References**

- ✅ Updated `backend/app/main.py` to import from `movie_service`

### **3. Verified No Errors**

- ✅ `routes/movies.py` - **No errors found**

4. **Import Confusion**: Routes were updated to use the temporary file
